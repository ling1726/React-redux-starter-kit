# React redux starter kit

## Usage 
`$ npm start`

The project is available through `http://localhost:8080`

## Description 
This react redux starter kit is a template for all my react projects. Anyone may use this boilerpate project to start their own. I will try to keep this project updated with the latest packages that I deem necessary to create a good application. 

The project currently runs on a webpack development server and the implementation of proxies/backend is up to the user. To hook up an existing backend using the webpack dev server please [refer to this article](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-proxy)

Any improvement ideas are certainly welcome !
